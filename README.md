## 📚 Background: What Is Bad Time Simulator?

Let me give you a little context if you're not familiar.

In **Undertale** – a cult-classic indie game – there's a route called the **Genocide Route**, where you fight every character in the game. At the very end of this route, you fight **Sans**, the most difficult boss in the game.

This fight is known for being:
- Fast
- Brutal
- Emotionally intense
- And full of surprises

“Bad Time Simulator” is a fan-made recreation of this fight, built with love by fans of the original game. What you see here is a simplified, browser-playable version.
